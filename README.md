# my website
hi, this is my website that i made from scratch in visual studio code and replit.
ill link some tools i used to create assets from this website further down in this description.
### stuff to know
i do not have a copyright claim for this website, so copy it if you want, it will only make me feel better if you copy it because it shows that my code is good enough for people to try to have it for themselves.
anyways, this website didnt have much effort put into it, and took only a day or two to code.
### tools used
for the logo gif
https://www.3dgifmaker.com/
https://ezgif.com/resize
for the background particles
https://particles.js.org/
if you want to use tsparticles its kind of difficult, so i would reccommend watching a tutorial on how to use it for importing into your website.
### thanks for reading!
if you've read this far, thanks for checking out the github for my website, im pretty proud of my creation.
